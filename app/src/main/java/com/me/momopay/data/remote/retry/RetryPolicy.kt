/**
 * Retry policy with exponential backoff.
 *
 * delayFactor is used to multiply delayMillis to increase the delay for the next retry.
 *
 * For instance, given a policy with numRetries of 4, delayMillis of 400ms and delayFactor of 2:
 *  - first retry: effective delayMillis will be 400
 *  - second retry: effective delayMillis will be 800
 *  - third retry: effective delayMillis will be 1600
 *  - forth retry: effective delayMillis will be 3200
 *
 * If no exponential backoff is desired, set delayFactor to 1
